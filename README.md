## Implement a design from scratch
### Introduction

In this project, I will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly). I will use all HTML, CSS, Accessibility, Responsive design, Bootstrap and Javascript knowledges that I learned previously.

I wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, I'm free to implement it the way that I want 

### Objective

### Requirements
